# DaimondPricePrediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on features such as carat, cut, color, and clarity.
Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
Implemented linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble models to optimize prediction accuracy.
Evaluated model performance using RÂ² score, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).
Deployed the model using Flask/Streamlit for an interactive user experience.
