 DaimondPricePrediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on carat, cut, color, and clarity features.

Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

Implemented linear regression to optimize prediction accuracy.

Evaluated model performance using RÂ² score, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).
